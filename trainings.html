        <p style="color: white; text-align: center;">The different methods of training
            All methods of training need to be specific to the individual performer, component of fitness and the activity.<br><br>
            
            Continuous training develops cardiovascular fitness:<br>
            A minimum of 20 minutes sub-maximal work.<br>
            Target heart rate range between 60% - 80% maximum heart rate (maxHR).<br>
            Swimming, running, cycling, walking or a combination of these disciplines.<br>
            Disadvantage - some participants find longer sessions to be boring.<br>
            Fartlek (speed play) training develops a range of components and is used by games players.<br><br>
            
            A continuous form of training:<br>
            Changes in speed, incline and terrain are used to provide changes in exercise intensity.<br>
            Aerobic and anaerobic work can be done in the quantities that suit the performer.<br>
            Disadvantage - some urban areas have little variety of incline and terrain.<br>
            Interval training develops strength, speed and muscular endurance.<br><br>
            
            Periods of intense work interspersed with timed rest:<br>
            A wide variety of fitness types can be developed.<br>
            Structured in reps and sets.<br>
            Intensity is measured by % maxHR.<br>
            Disadvantage - maximal nature of intervals can be too challenging for some participants.<br>
            Weight training develops strength.<br><br>
            
            An interval form of training.<br>
            Intensity is measured in a percentage of the most weight a person can lift one time and is known as % 1 REP MAX.<br>
            Time is structured in reps and sets with specific timings for recovery between sets.<br>
            Huge range of possible lifts combining machines, free weights and body weight exercises.<br>
            Disadvantage - many performers use poor technique while striving for an even heavier weight.<br>
            Plyometric training develops power.<br><br>
            
            High intensity exercise involving explosive movements:<br>
            The muscle is lengthened and then rapidly shortened to develop the explosive capability of the muscle.<br>
            Suitable for well-trained athletes.<br>
            Very effective for developing power.<br>
            Disadvantage - can cause injury if athlete is not in excellent condition.<br>
            Flexibility training develops flexibility.<br><br>
            
            Essential training for all athletes in all sports and activities:<br>
            Time is measured by the length of hold and the recovery period between holds.<br>
            Intensity is measured as a percentage of range of motion (%ROM).<br>
            Disadvantage - underused by many athletes.<br><br>
            
            Circuit training:<br>
            This develops muscular endurance, strength and/or cardiovascular fitness.<br>
            An interval form of training.<br>
            Stations are set out that train one or more components of fitness.<br>
            The performer moves from one station to the next with exercise periods and rest periods.<br>
            Circuits can be designed so that they are sport-specific.<br>
            Exercise classes such as yoga, pilates, body pump and spinning.<br><br>
            
            Very popular exercise formats:<br>
            Yoga, body pump and pilates are outstanding for developing core strength and whole body conditioning.<br>
            Spinning develops cardiovascular fitness and muscular endurance.<br>
            Group format helps to motivate participants to work harder.<br>
            Disadvantage - can be costly and sometimes carries the unfair reputation of a non-serious training method.</p><br>
